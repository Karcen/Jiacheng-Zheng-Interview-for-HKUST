1. For each pyrolysis combination in Annex I, analyze the yield of pyrolysis products (tar, water, coke residue, syngas) in relation to themixing ratios of the corresponding pyrolysis combinations, and explainwhether desulfurization ash, as far as it is used as a catalyst, plays asignificant role in facilitating the pyrolysis of cotton stalks, cellulose, andlignin?
2. According to Annex Il, for each of the three pyrolysiscombinations, the effect of the mixing ratio of the pyrolysis combinationson the yield of each group of pyrolysis gas is discussed and explained bymaking corresponding images.
3. Under the catalytic action of the same proportion of desulfurizedash, is there a significant difference in the yields of the productsgenerated from the pyrolysis of CE and LG, as well as the yields of thecomponents of the pyrolysis gas? Please provide reasons.
4. How do we establish a catalytic reaction mechanism model of desulfurized ash for model compounds such as CE and LG and model the reaction kinetics for analysis?
5. Please use mathematical models or AI learning methods to make predictions on the yields or quantities of the pyrolysis products under limited data conditions
